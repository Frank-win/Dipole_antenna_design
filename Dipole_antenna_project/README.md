üìà Results

The antenna was designed for 3.3 GHz operation.

Simulation results include return loss (S11) and radiation patterns.

Geometry and settings are provided so others can reproduce the design.

üìù Notes

The Results from the far firled radiation pattern and the gain value indicates it is omni-directional

Results may vary depending on mesh settings and boundary conditions.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
